          <p>this ones special - think of it as my structured place for all my unsaid thoughts, things that i gatekeep, things that has never seen the light, a public archive, or just blog as anyone prefers to call it.</p>
          <p>i have so much stuff that i think i need to improve, not for the impression. but for myself to truly polish everything that i do. it's a balanced level of standard i'm trying to achieve, not too high - not too low either.</p>
          <p>i want to showcase here just about everything, even the not-so-important ones, something i really want to show to anyone but never had the will, because of lingering second-guesses, what ifs, and silent judgements.</p>

      <div class="section-wrapper">
        <h2>ig doc project</h2>
        <a href="../wireframe/doc/">view -></a>
        <p>i started the idea of documenting my life back in february, as a silent rant against curated content, where everything has to be aesthetically pleasing, even on personal life. thing is - not all the time a person has to face that way, the appeal is there but surely masks you off because it doesnt feel real in a way, its just not it.</p>
        <p>so i recovered my ig account from 2023 and decided to take a photo everyday, black and white to bore people, even the mundane ones,everyday it has to be taken.</p>
        <p>although as im writing this, i feel like the idea wasn't working, or is it just me? cause if this a documentary then i should be taking photo in the most random time, not when i feel like it?</p>
        <p>also it seems like my perfectionism isnt really going far either, i always look back at my documentations and get concerned about the compositions, lighting, even if i don't have to.</p>
        <p>or maybe im just not so consistent enough, i noticed when i make something specially when programming stuff, once i have the core functions working, i just keep going, i think of things in a most modular way - like when i built LDE from ground up and now im able to build apps using that core. now for documentary, its really hard to pull that off, maybe i dont have enough color grading skills (yes, even in BW shots has color grading) to make my photos consistent.</p>

    <section id="my-roadmap" aria-label="my roadmap">
      <div class="section-wrapper">
        <h2>my roadmap</h2>
        <p>i want to remain consistent at everything - even if im not very good at it, i don't want my skillset looking like a bar graph where first graph is significantly higher than the second graph, if that even makes sense</p>
        <p>so lets say...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>web development, confident</li>
          <li>time management, not confident</li>
          <li>academics, not confident</li>
          <li>communications and socializing, not confident</li>
          <li>app development, not confident</li>
          <li>health and fitness, not confident</li>
          <li>art and design, not confident</li>
          <li>cooking, not confident</li>
          <li>playing guitar, not confident</li>
          <li>photography, not confident</li>
        </ul>
        <p>while im able to do them all, they all dont share same level, and that is totally normal for everyone. but i somehow have this mission where if im able to pull that off - i would be very happy, for myself. its a different kind of goal to achieve.</p>
        <p>thing is, this is very very broad and dividing them to small chunks multiplied by how many areas i need to improve myself at - not so realistic. combining it with documentary seems like a good idea though, but only if im very disciplined enough</p>
        <p>its not like im hitting the level of being good, thats so unfair compared to other professionals.
        what i meant when leveling all the bars is that when i feel like my skills complements with the other, and i feel happy about it</p>
        <h3>I want to build a life where all the things I care about fit together—where my skills, my routines, and my stories don’t compete, but complement each other.
        I want to feel like myself in everything I do, not just in the things I’m good at.
        I’m not chasing perfection. I’m chasing coherence.
        Even if it takes five years, even if it’s quiet and slow—I just want to look back one day and see that I lived in harmony with who I really am.</h3>
